  abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the nature of tutor and student online communication and collaboration activities in a blended learning course. The hypothesis that these activities are related to student learning performance (exam results) was tested based on the number of messages posted, as well as the nature of these messages (type of content transmitted in terms of course content-related, interpersonal and organizational activities). Descriptive results show that tutors were mainly involved in organizational tasks, whereas students communicated mostly at content-related and interpersonal levels. Student performance was not related to the quantity of tutors' activity, but to the quantity of students' activity. Closer examination of the nature of different activities showed that not only tutors' interpersonal, but also students' own content-related and interpersonal messages had an impact on students' learning performance. This study raises the possibility that the nature of messages is more important than their quantity. It calls into question former research, which has indicated the importance of the amount of activity while mostly neglecting to discriminate between the differences in nature of activities and which has based its findings almost entirely on subjective ratings for both activities and performance. Implications for evaluation of activities and design of personal support are discussed.},

abstract = {The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. Consider writing, perhaps the first information technology: The ability to capture a symbolic representation of spoken language for long-term storage freed information from the limits of individual memory. Today this technology is ubiquitous in industrialized countries. Not only do books, magazines and newspapers convey written information, but so do street signs, billboards, shop signs and even graffiti. Candy wrappers are covered in writing. The constant background presence of these products of "literacy technology" does not require active attention, but the information to be conveyed is ready for use at a glance. It is difficult to imagine modern life otherwise. Silicon-based information technology, in contrast, is far from having become part of the environment. More than 50 million personal computers have been sold, and nonetheless the computer remains largely in a world of its own. It is approachable only through complex jargon that has nothing to do with the tasks for which which people actually use computers. The state of the art is perhaps analogous to the period when scribes had to know as much about making ink or baking clay as they did about writing.},

Thus, while it uses some techniques that may already be familiar to you, such as fluid grids using percentages instead of fixed width, it goes beyond form to include function as well. Web standards guru Jeffrey Zeldman identifies the problem as being a "standards nightmare" when it comes to hardware. The benefit to you, dear webmaster, should be obvious: one site across various platforms that optimizes itself for that platform. Another benefit is that, by redesigning responsively, you're future proofing your site. Not eternity proofing, but the next few cycles proofing. The benefit for end users is that they get a good experience regardless the device or devices from which they're accessing your site.},

abstract = {The rich person-to-person interaction afforded by shared physical workspaces allows people to maintain up-to-the minute knowledge about others’ interaction with the task environment. This knowledge is workspace awareness, part of the glue that allows groups to collaborate effectively. In real-time groupware systems that provide a shared virtual space for collaboration, the possibilities for interaction are impoverished when compared with their physical counterparts. In this paper, we present the concept of workspace awareness as one key to supporting the richness evident in face-to-face interaction. We construct a conceptual framework that describes the elements and mechanisms of workspace awareness, and apply the framework to the design ofwidgets that help people maintain awareness in real-time distributed groupware. Our evaluation of these widgets has shown that several designs improve the usability of groupware applications.v},

abstract = {Laboratory-based courses play a critical role in scientific education. Automation is changing the nature of these laboratories, and there is a long-running debate about the value of hands-on versus simulated laboratories. In addition, the introduction of remote laboratories adds a third category to the debate. Through a review of the literature related to these labs in education, the authors draw several conclusions about the state of current research. The debate over different technologies is confounded by the use of different educational objectives as criteria for judging the laboratories: Hands-on advocates emphasize design skills, while remote lab advocates focus on conceptual understanding. We observe that the boundaries among the three labs are blurred in the sense that most laboratories are mediated by computers, and that the psychology of presence may be as important as technology. We also discuss areas for future research.
